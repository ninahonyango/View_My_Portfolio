# 👋 Hi there, I'm Elizabeth P. A Onyango!

🎯 Cybersecurity & Network Admin | Blue Team Enthusiast | Problem Solver


I specialize in defending networks, analyzing vulnerabilities, and configuring secure infrastructures. Whether it’s inspecting packet captures in Wireshark, setting up pfSense firewalls, or documenting real-world lab exploits in Kali Linux — I’m passionate about keeping systems resilient and secure.
